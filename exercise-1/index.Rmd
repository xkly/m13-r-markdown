### Exercise 1 ###

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)

# Store a variable "movie"
movie <- 'Almost Famous'
# Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # Your parameters should include a "query" and an "api_key"
  # Note: the HTTR library will take care of spaces in the arguments
  # See the interactive console for more detail:https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
  
  base.url <- "http://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?"
  query.params <- list(query = movie, api_key = "d9941f8ea4ce4a4f8e90d5fd30aa729d")
  
  
  # Request data using your search query
  request <- GET(base.url, query = query.params)
  movie.data <- fromJSON(content(request, "text"))
  
  # Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  movie.data <- flatten(movie.data$results)
  
  # From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article each in their own variables
  movie.headline <- movie.data$headline
  movie.short.summary <- movie.data$summary_short
  movie.link <- movie.data$link.url

  # Return an list of the three pieces of information from above
  return(list(headline = movie.headline, short.summary = movie.short.summary, link = movie.link))
  
}


# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview(movie)

```

# `r movie`

## `r movie.info$headline`

> `r movie.info$short.summary`

Follow [this link](`r movie.info$link`) to read the full review
